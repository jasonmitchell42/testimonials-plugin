# testimonials-plugin
Reason for creating this pluging is for a website that i've created that needs to have testmionails added once then used in 2 different applications on the website.  There are other plugins out there but nothing that did just want i wanted without having to pay.  This also serves as further plugin dev experience.

Adding custom WordPress Plugin to create a CTP for testimonials and then output a slick slider showing the testimonial title and excerpt.
